Finding probabilities for unique characters.
In this assignment we have to trace each of the characters(all symbols, not only letters) in the informational text and discover their probabilities from each of them. Accordingly, the most frequent characters will have a higher probability, and vice versa. We decided to execute this task through Jupyter Notebook(Python3), since this language is easier to understand.
